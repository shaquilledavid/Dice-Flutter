# Dice App ðŸŽ²

Dice App is a simple app which simulated rolling of two dice. I learned how to code this app from Module 7 from the Flutter development course at https://www.appbrewery.co/courses/intro-to-flutter.

# Things learned from this Module

- How to use Flutter stateless widgets to design the user interface.
